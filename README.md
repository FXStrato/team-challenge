# Team Testing Challenge

This folder contains code for a validating sign-up form, created as part of the Team Testing Challenge.

The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### Which team members were responsible for which features? #####
> Evan Frawley -- BirthdayInput & reSet button
 Jeff Zhong -- creating the initial project structure & password and passwordConfrimation part
 Yicheng Jiang -- EmailInput, css for the sign up form and README 
 Eric -- NameInput & submit button

_Note: If there are any issues with group collaboration, let me know now **before** the final project!_
 We should make more efficient communication next time and do everything early. 
 We should meet up to fix problems rather than discussion online because it is hard to fix errors by just talking

> Yeah, kind of. We looked up the tutorial for the shallow and mount render. And one of members asked Joel for help 


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 12hrs


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 4


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
